In Lab Task 1
Extend the Java code implementation of the coffee ordering system to include the following:
1. Implement the base classes for different types of coffee drinks, such as Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
2. Create decorator classes for various additional ingredients, such as MilkDecorator, SugarDecorator,
and WhippedCreamDecorator.
3. Implement the cost calculation logic in the decorator classes to calculate the total cost of each
coffee drink with added ingredients.

Lab Assignment
Assignment 1: Real-World Scenario (Adapter Pattern)
Suppose you are developing a pizza ordering system. The system should allow customers to customize
their pizzas with various toppings such as cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, etc. However, the available
toppings may vary, and new toppings could be added in the future. You need to design a flexible solution
to handle this scenario.
Requirements:
1. Customers should be able to choose the type of crust for their pizza (e.g., thin crust, thick crust,
stuffed crust).
2. Customers should be able to select the size of the pizza (e.g., small, medium, large).
3. Customers should be able to add toppings to their pizza, with the option to select multiple toppings.
4. The system should calculate the total price of the pizza based on the selected options.
5. Customers should be able to add special instructions or comments for each order.
